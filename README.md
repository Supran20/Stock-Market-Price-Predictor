# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using LSTM and Streamlit

This project is a **web-based stock price predictor** built using **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks and **Streamlit**. It takes historical stock data and forecasts future trends using deep learning. The app allows users to input a stock symbol and visualize price trends alongside moving averages and predictions.

## 🚀 Features

- Fetches live historical stock data from **Yahoo Finance**
- Preprocesses and scales the data using **MinMaxScaler**
- Visualizes:
  - 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages
  - Actual vs Predicted stock prices
- Uses a **stacked LSTM model** with dropout layers for robust prediction
- Built with a clean and interactive **Streamlit** interface
